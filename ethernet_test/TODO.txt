Add bit offset to pack_tm function in format.c (DONE-ish)
    - In order to avoid padding in data string to accomodate the different packet types
        - DONE, but need to add the actual offset into the pack_tm function. 

Define a CRC system.

Define if the RTC in ack packet shall be from the MCU(FPGA) or same as the tc received.
    - For now it is from the tc received.

Finish packet validity check.
    - Dependent on the above defininition.

Create testing setups.
    - DONE

Write proper readme files with config instructions.

Clean up the code
    - Comment clearing
    - File naming
        - DONE
    - Moving stuff into Kconfig instead of defining them in files
        - DONE
    - Remove all ESP_LOG shit as well probably
    - Clean the entire ethernet2 file (set up real send and receive functions and fix the task)

Add ethernet and uart deinit functions
    - They are there but not implemented and tested

Fix tests

Try the test_packet thing
    - Seems to be working but don't know for sure
    - Some tests in and it works fine.
    - Might be time to replace even in format file, but will have to test that first.

Would be nice to have the CONFIG sizes in the test files.
    - Don't know how since they don't compile with the other things, might also be why the #include is not working as intended.

Implement cut-off procedure
    - DONE Started with confirmation_task
    - Need to make kill function to tear down everything.
        - Might be best to have in the main function.
        - Use a struct to have callback pointer from tcp_server_task to indicate kill. (essentially same as for confirmation_task)

Implement proper error handling
