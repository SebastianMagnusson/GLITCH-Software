Add bit offset to pack_tm function in format.c (DONE-ish)
    - In order to avoid padding in data string to accomodate the different packet types
        - DONE , but need to add the actual offset into the pack_tm function. 

Define a CRC system.

Define if the RTC in ack packet shall be from the MCU(FPGA) or same as the tc received.
    - For now it is from the tc received.

Finish packet validity check.
    - Dependent on the above defininition.

Create testing setups.

Write proper readme files with config instructions.
