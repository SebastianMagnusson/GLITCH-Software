Add bit offset to pack_tm function in format.c (DONE-ish)
    - In order to avoid padding in data string to accomodate the different packet types
        - DONE, but need to add the actual offset into the pack_tm function. 

Define a CRC system.

Define if the RTC in ack packet shall be from the MCU(FPGA) or same as the tc received.
    - For now it is from the tc received.

Finish packet validity check.
    - Dependent on the above defininition.

Create testing setups.
    - DONE

Write proper readme files with config instructions.

Clean up the code
    - DONE Comment clearing
    - DONE File naming
    - DONE Moving stuff into Kconfig instead of defining them in files
    - Remove all ESP_LOG shit as well probably
    - DONE (Kinda) Clean the entire ethernet2 file

Add ethernet and uart deinit functions
    - They are there but not implemented and tested

Fix tests

Try the test_packet thing
    - Seems to be working but don't know for sure
    - Some tests in and it works fine.
    - Might be time to replace even in format file, but will have to test that first.

Would be nice to have the CONFIG packet and data sizes in the test files.
    - Don't know how since they don't compile with the other things, might also be why the #include is not working as intended.

Implement cut-off procedure
    - DONE Started with confirmation_task
    - DONE (Not as a function but in the main and ethernet tasks) Need to make kill function to tear down everything.
        - DONE Might be best to have in the main function.
        - DONE Use a struct to have callback pointer from tcp_server_task to indicate kill. (essentially same as for confirmation_task)
        - DONE Have the buffer be drained before killing ethernet task.

Implement proper error handling

Implement the radiation data things
    - buffer
    - sorter
    - sending
